### Course Description
While the idea of virtual reality (VR) has been around for many years, recent commercial availability of hardware and software is spurring renewed interest. This course covers the development of virtual reality worlds, including mathematical basis of motion and physics in VR worlds, human visual perception, design practices to enable immersive experiences for users, and development on heterogeneous device hardware. A major component of the course will be a final project where students develop their own VR worlds based on the design practices discussed during the course.
